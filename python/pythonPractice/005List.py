# Python supports collections known as lists.
c = [5,2,10,48,32,16,49,10,11,32,64,55,34,45,41,23,26,27,72,18]

print(c[0])
print(c[1])
# To print the last element, you can count from the back using the minus sign.
print(c[-1])


# You can get the length of the list using the len function. Example code:
print(len(c))
print("Length: " + str( len(c) ))
